# FastForwardLink

Fast-forward from one or more notes to a single target note with ease. Create custom link abbreviations (like `ps` > `photoshop`) to type faster, create conceptual connections between terms, navigate between notes quicker, and keep your vault organized.

## Introduction

FastForwardLink lets you redirect multiple links to a single note, creating a seamless and organized navigation experience. You can Obsidian links that are effectively synonymous.

For example, including `[[ps]]` in a note would create or navigate to note called `ps`. With FastForwardLink, it would automatically forward you to the to real target note, titled `photoshop` (or anything else you've defined as the target note).

Common cases include:

-   `ps` > `photoshop`
-   `js` > `javascript`
-   `tay tay` > `taylor swift`
-   `46` > `joe biden`
-   `e=mc2` > `Einstein's special theory of relativity`
-   `favorite film` > `bill and ted's bogus journey`

FastForwardLink helps you write faster, keep your notes interconnected, and minimize navigation friction in your vault.
